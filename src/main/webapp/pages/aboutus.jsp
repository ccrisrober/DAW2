    <p class="bigline">WrapBootstrap is a marketplace where designers can sell their own themes and templates based on the Bootstrap framework.</p>
    <p>Bootstrap is beginning to reach wide-spread adoption amongst developers and many have expressed their desire for design customization beyond the default styles. This marketplace was created to solve that need by allowing designers to upload and sell their own themes and templates based on Bootstrap. Sellers are able to choose from several usage licenses to sell their items under and earn a percentage of each sale.</p>
    <p><strong>WrapBootstrap was launched February 10th, 2012.</strong></p>
